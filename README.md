Solar Blockchain Network

sun was conceived as I hadn't noticed a blockchain network or mining pool which fit sun's off-grid criteria:
sun criteria: 100% solar electricity generated on-site, no grid-tied systems used, high-uptime satellite network
sun vision: blockchain mining, off-electric-grid defining, decentralized Bitcoin mining platform
sun hardware: solar energy generation hardware all-in-one machines, off-grid generators with passive mining capability
sun grandiose: solar energy encryption industry trailblazing startup
sun elevated: decode with light, decode light within light, we are all one
